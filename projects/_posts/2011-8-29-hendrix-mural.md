One of the many awesome things about Harvey Mudd College is that you can petition to paint your dorm room. I've wanted to do something for a while and I finally found something I want to make. I found this image online of Jimi Hendrix. I don't know who made it or how, but I thought it was really cool and easy enough to paint (if I traced it ;).

Anyways, that's what I did. I borrowed a projector from a friend, positioned it precariously on a pile of books and tables, and got all of my roomates to help me trace any lines or edges.

Then we got to painting it. It took about a week of causally painting in the evenings, looking at ridiculously zoomed in portions of the image to make sense of the weird edges that wound up traces on the wall.

In the end, it turned out AWESOME.

I was so impressed with myself. Now, I did trace this. No one is denying that. But I couldn't believe how well it turned out! I'm super pumped to do this again sometime. All you need is a projector, some patience, and some kind of graphic to trace. This is how it looks in my dorm room.

And here's a before/after pic.

I've got to say, there were many moments when we thought this wasn't going to turn out well. If you zoom in and focus only on the lips or the fingers, you realize how weird this image is. But when you step away, it all looks great.

And, by the way, my friend [Amanda Lipp](http://www.amandalipp.com/crayon-art) does art as well. Go check out her crayon art.
