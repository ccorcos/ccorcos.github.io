title: 5C Menu iPhone App - Round 2
---

This winter break, I've decided to rebuild the old [5C Menu iPhone App](/projects/2012/06/02/5c-menu-app.html). I've learned some lessons the the past few years and I figured I could make it much quicker this time.

For one, I used [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and their new [Cordova integration](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Cordova-Phonegap-integration). I built a handy Meteor package for creating [swipable views](https://github.com/ccorcos/meteor-swipe) for each menu. This version contains all 7 dining halls now and works on any platform (althrough I have yet to release it on Android).

This project is [up and running in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/5c-menu/id512440171?mt=8){: .link}. The [code is open source](https://github.com/ccorcos/5cmenu){: .link} although the codebase is pretty messy (I only worked on this for 2 days). You can also visit the [5C Menu online](http://5cmenu.com/).
