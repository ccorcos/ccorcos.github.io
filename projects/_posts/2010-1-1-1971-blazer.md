title: 1971 Blazer Restoration
---

When I was home for winter break after my freshman year of college, my dad and I did a quick restoration of a 1970 Blazer. We wanted to keep this one rugged which allowed us to work a lot quicker. It took us only a month to everything except the paint. We rebuilt the motor which was already in pretty good condition. And we refurbished all the interior.
