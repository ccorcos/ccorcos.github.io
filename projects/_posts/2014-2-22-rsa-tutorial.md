title: RSA Encryption Tutorial
---

https://github.com/ccorcos/rsa-tutorial

I've been interested in encryption lately and I came across the concept of [asymmetric encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography){: .link} which is way cool.

One such encryption scheme is [RSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)){: .link} and it is widely used for SSL, SSH, and PGP. [Wikipedia has a good explanation of how the algorithm works](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Key_generation){: .link} so I took the time to understand it and code up an implementation in python along with a tutorial explaining how it works. [The code is available on my Github](https://github.com/ccorcos/rsa-tutorial){: .link} for you to check out.

Simply run this at the commandline.

    $ git clone https://github.com/ccorcos/rsa-tutorial.git
    $ cd rsa-tutorial
    $ python rsa.py

Here's what the tutorial looks like.
