  <p>I'm currently working at <a class="link" href="https://www.affirm.com">Affirm</a> building their consumer products on the web. In the past, I studied robotics and machine learning at the University of Southern California and recieved a Masters in the Fall of 2015. Before that I attended Harvey Mudd College and received a B.S. in Engineering in the Fall of 2013. I try to dabble in just about everything.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I love tinkering on side projects, and I've taken a liking for building slick user interfaces. I also play guitar and I'm always looking for a good jam sesh.</p>
