  <p>I am currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC) which I began in the Fall of 2013. I'm doing robotics research in the <a class="link" href="http://robotics.usc.edu/resl/">Robotic Embedded Systems Lab (RESL)</a>. Before that I attended Harvey Mudd College and received a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering with a focus on control systems.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I love tinkering and hacking on side projects. Recently, I've become a huge fan of making web and mobile apps with <a class="link" href="http://www.meteor.com">Meteor</a>.</p>
